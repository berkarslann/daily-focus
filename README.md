People have to constantly increase their working capacity to do something well. This is the most important, if not the only, element of success. The Daily'Focus technique helps you increase your working volume and keep your focus. Thus, you increase your working capacity.
This method has created to increase focusing. I adapted a method applied in weightlifting to real life in order to increase our working concentration.  

This website was made to keep track of the components available in this method.


1 Daily Focus cycle is 4 weeks.

In this method, we have 3 main objects:
 
 -Daily'min: The minimum number of pomodoros we will apply each working day. It must be same 

 -Daily'max:The maximum number of pomodoros we will apply each working day.
 
 -Pomodoro: It is a method to increase focusing. We use this method in this technique.
 
 HOW TO USE DAILY'FOCUS METHOD?
 
 1. Plan and think about how many days per week you will work for a 4-week cycle, what to focus on and what you need to do to improve yourself.


2. Set a daily'min for the 4-week cycle. Our recommendation is 1 or 2 pomodoros. Remember; you have to complete the daily'min pomodoro you choose no matter what.

3. If you feel good on your working day, after exceeding one daily'min pomodoro, set the daily'max for that day and try to exceed it.
